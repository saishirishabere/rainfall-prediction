# rainfall-prediction
In this project, I will be implementing a predictive model on Rain Dataset to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.The Dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations of different locations in Australia. By the end of this project, you will be able to build a predictive model.

# Objectives:
Design a predictive model with the use of machine learning algorithms to forecast whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.
# Dataset Description:
Number of columns: 23

Number of rows: 145460

Number of Independent Columns: 22

Number of Dependent Column: 1

# Problem Statement:

Build an efficient Classification Model that should predict whether it Rains Tomorrow or not, using the dataset Rain in Australia.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this EDA part I have to do the following steps.

# Feature Engineering

Data Preprocessing
Missing Data We can use seaborn to create a simple heatmap
